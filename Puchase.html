			Marvel's Spider-Man is an action-adventure game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4, based on the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man. Released worldwide on September 7, 2018, it was the first licensed game developed by Insomniac. The game tells an original story about Spider-Man that is not tied to any other existing piece of media, and covers both the Peter Parker and Spider-Man aspects of the character.

			Critics called Spider-Man one of the best video games ever made, praising its gameplay, particularly the combat and web-swinging mechanics, graphics, narrative, characterization, and design of New York City, though felt it lacked innovation in its open world design. The game became a commercial success, selling 3.3 million copies in its first three days of release, becoming the fastest-selling video game in Sony Interactive Entertainment's history and one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 games.
